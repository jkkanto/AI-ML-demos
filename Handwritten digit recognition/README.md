# Handwritten digit recognition

The purpose of this code snippet is to demonstrate building of nn-model from scratch to perform handwritten digit recognition. For this purpose, we can utilize the MNIST dataset, a classic in the field of machine learning. The MNIST dataset consists of 70 000 handwritten digits (0 through 9), each represented as a 28x28 pixel grayscale image. Our goal will be to develop a model that can accurately classify these images into the correct digit. For this task, we select convolutional neural network (CNN).

Finally we test model by creating a handwritten digit, scale it to 28x28 image, process the image, and perform prediction.
